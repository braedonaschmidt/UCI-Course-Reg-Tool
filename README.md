# Double Dip
 A program to help you *double dip* with classes at UCI.
 
## Motivation
 I was trying to plan my schedule as an incoming 1st year, but I realized that there seemed like a lot of classes overlapped between the General Education courses, and my Major and Minor. So put together a little web scraper to benefit myself and other students at this campus, to help them save a bit of time and money.

## How Do I Use It?
* Just download the folder from [here] and unzip it!
* If Windows tells you that it *seems suspicious*, tell it to run anyway (if you trust me). That issue arises because the program is one large executable file.
* Once it's running, just select the two majors and/or minors you want to compare, or choose "GE" for one of the options to see what overlaps with the General Education claseses. If "GE" is selected, brackets will be shown after each class saying which GE requirement it can fill.
* Click the "Export to .txt" button to generate a file in the DoubleDip folder for easy reference!

## To-Do:
* **Fix the issue with getting study area names**
* **Show current classes offered**
* **Filter by GE Category**
* **Make the code pretty**
* **Add support for alternative course names**
* **ClassLookup.get_prefix() exception handling** (if/else check for prefix won't work with 1st class not having prefix)
* **Address Windows Defender security concern**
* **Clean up UI**
* **Organize files**
* ~~Make .exe~~
* ~~More areas of study~~
* ~~Export txt file for classes~~
